When in a red room:
- Portal A seems to keep you in a red room
- Portal B sometimes leads to green, sometimes red
- Portal C sometimes leads to green, sometimes red

When in a green room:
- Portal A seems to keep you in a green room
- Portal B seems to lead to a red room
- Portal C seems to lead to a red room

Looking at the last few steps:
- C -> green room
- B -> red room 
- A -> red room
- B -> ?

Since we're in a red room and taking portal B, and looking at the patterns when in a red room taking portal B, it appears to sometimes lead to green and sometimes red. However, examining more closely, there seems to be a pattern where if you're in a red room and take portal B after having taken portal A, it leads to a green room.

1) First, I'll note that each room has fixed portal behaviors, and there are only 3 rooms total.

2) Looking at patterns:
- When in a red room, portal B sometimes leads to red, sometimes to green
- When in a green room, portal B sometimes leads to red
- Portal A from red rooms seems to consistently lead to red rooms
- Portal C behavior varies but seems to follow a pattern

3) Looking at sequences:
- The pattern ""B->red, B->red"" appears at the start
- ""C->red, A->red"" appears multiple times
- ""C->green, A->green"" appears multiple times

4) Most importantly, looking at the last few steps:
- B->red
- C->red 
- B->???

5) Since we're in a red room and taking portal B, and looking at earlier patterns when B was taken from red rooms, it should lead to a green room.

Looking at the sequence, I notice:
- Portal B alternates between taking you to red and green rooms
- Portal C seems to consistently take you to red rooms when coming from a green room
- Portal A seems to keep you in whatever color room you're in

For the last step:
- The second-to-last move was portal C leading to a red room
- The last move is portal B
- Based on the pattern, when taking portal B from a red room, you always end up in a green room

Therefore:
